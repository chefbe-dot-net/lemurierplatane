# Capestang

Capestang is located at the heart of the Languedoc, to the south of Orb-valley. It is very typical of this area. Small streets and passages surround a very beautiful and dominant 13th century Gothic church. One can climb the church-tower and admire the vast surrounding countryside. On the village square, shaded by magnificent plane trees, it is market-time every Wednesday and Sunday.The village is bordered by the Canal du Midi on the North side, this wonderful waterway again shaded by hundreds of plane trees. All around the village, vineyards stretch for miles and miles, changing colours with the seasons.
