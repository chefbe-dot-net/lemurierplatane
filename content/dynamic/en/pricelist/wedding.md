#  "Marriages" or "Special occasions" option

Have you been invited to a marriage or some other special event in the region?

It would be our pleasure to have you as our guest! 

Considering your needs when travelling for such occasions, and based on our experience, we propose our “special occasions” option:

* Room available upon arrival from 2 pm. (rather than from 4 pm.): €5 extra per room.
* Later check out time of 12 noon (rather than 11 am) with breakfast served until 11 am (rather than 10 am): €5 extra per room.
