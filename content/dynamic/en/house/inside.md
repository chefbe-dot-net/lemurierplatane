# Inside the house

The sitting room has been built in an old barn that used to house the tools and carts which were used in the grape-harvest and winemaking process. There is a seating area and a dining-room area. Guests will find all necessary kitchen utensils here (from 11 am to 5 pm) so that light meals can be prepared and cooked.

The wine-cellar is on the ground-floor and was originally part of a typical “winemaker’s" house, older than the present main house (which is 120 years old). 
This wine-cellar has been rebuilt : here you will find a library with a good selection of books (fiction and reference), tourist information and board games.
