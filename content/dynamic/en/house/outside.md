# Outside the house

In the middle of the 20th century the owner managed to buy a bit of land at the back of the house and laid down a garden. He opened up a door and windows in the back-wall of the house (the old town wall). He reduced the thickness of the wall (from 1m35 to 85 cm) in the process. The windows are small as is usual in this part of the world, to keep the house cool. 

In the garden you will find chairs and tables, and some comfortable reclining chairs under a spacious and wonderfully shaded lean-to (for afternoon siestas).
The swimming-pool (7 by 3.5m) is open from 10.00 am to 7.30 pm. We will ask you to sign a liability disclaimer-form if you have children. The pool is fenced off for security reasons and an alarm has been installed.

The central courtyard is the ideal place for your breakfast in the summer.
