# Capestang and surroundings

Capestang is a very nice and typical village, and also an ideal starting point for excursions, by foot, on the bike or by car. There are 600 km of footpaths around this area, with great views over vineyards, the river Orb, the Canal, the hills. And just half an hour from here, the Mediterranean Sea awaits you : wide sunny beaches, with all the seaside pleasures. Possibly, on your drive home, a pretty little café terrace in a Languedoc village will take your fancy : do be tempted ...!
