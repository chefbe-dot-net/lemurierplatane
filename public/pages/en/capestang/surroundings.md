# The surroundings

The Languedoc has always been appreciated for its location by the Mediterranean Sea, and for its mild climate. The Romans liked it , and settled here. Many ruins now still bear witness to their presence : the Gallo-Roman Oppidum of Enserune (very near), the wonderful mosaics of the Roman villa at Loupian, the paintings in the Archaeological Museum of Narbonne, the many traces of the Via Domitia.

After the Gallo-Roman era, the Middle Ages left their magnificent and mysterious mark : the abbeys of Fontcaude, Fontfroide, Valmagne, and the ancient cities of Carcassonne and Minerve. And everywhere you will find beautiful Romanesque and Gothic churches in medieval villages.

The vineyards enriched the local population. It was partly to transport the wine that the Canal du Midi was dug out and built in the 17th century. This was an unbelievable feat of engineering, one of the most impressive stretches being the nine locks of Fonseranes in BÃ©ziers. In Capestang itself the beauty of the Canal with its plane trees will draw you back again and again for wonderful walks and bike-rides.
