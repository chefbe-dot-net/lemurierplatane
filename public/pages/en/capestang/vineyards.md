# The vineyards

The vineyards of the Languedoc are the most ancient and vast in France. They were planted in Roman times, developed in the Middle Ages by the monastic orders and became really successful in the 19th century. Faced with competition from other French regions, and more recently from the rest of the world, the winemakers of the Languedoc have really worked hard  and very successfully to improve the quality of their product. The wines of this area are therefore extremely pleasing to any wine-connoisseur, and we can promise you will make new and surprising discoveries here.

In our own immediate area, the "Terres d'orb", the winemakers will offer you "Pays d'Oc" wines, and the appellation contrôlée wines Coteaux du Languedoc. Best-known of those particular wines are the Saint Chinian and the Faugères.

Travel a few kilometres and you will find the Minervois wines, the Corbieres, Fitou and the Vins de la Clape.
