# Welcome

“Le Mûrier Platane” is located at the heart of the historic centre of Capestang, a village bordered by the Canal du Midi in the sunny region of Languedoc and halfway between Béziers and Narbonne. 

Our house is typical of this region, yet very unusual in the way we have used various outbuildings. The common rooms are spacious and varied: a 35 m2 sitting-room, a restored wine-cellar, a small library, a garden with swimming-pool. In the sitting room there are stairs and a gallery which offer a view towards the façade of the original winemaker’s house and which lead to the bedrooms. The four comfortable bedrooms each have a fridge/bar, a shower room or bathroom en suite and a separate W.C.

For your information: a “mûrier platane” is a tree which is very typical of this region, a cross between a mulberry tree and a plane tree. The very large leaves offer wonderful shade, much appreciated in the summer.
